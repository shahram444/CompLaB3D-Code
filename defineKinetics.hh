// The defineRxnKinetics function computes the rates at which different chemical species (substrates) are produced or consumed in a series of reactions, based on their current concentrations. This function is essential for updating the system's state over time. Let's dissect how it works based on the code you've provided:
// Parameters

//     C: A vector of doubles representing the current concentrations of different substrates.
//     subsR: A reference to a vector of doubles that will store the calculated rates of change (production or consumption) for each substrate.
//     mask: An integer indicating the type of space (e.g., pore or non-pore) for which the kinetics are being calculated.

// Process

//     Reaction Rate Constants:
//         k1, k2, and k3 are constants defining the speed of the respective chemical reactions.

//     Mask Check:
//         If mask is 0, it likely indicates a pore space where reactions can occur. For other values (non-pore space), no reactions are assumed, and all rates are set to 0.

//     Reaction Kinetics:
//         Based on the provided rate constants and the concentrations (C vector), the reaction rates for each substrate are calculated.

//     Reaction Mechanisms:
//     The reactions appear to be:
//         First Reaction: Involves H2O (water) turning into other products. The rate R1 is calculated as k1×[H2O]k1×[H2O] (assuming C[5] represents the concentration of H2O).
//         Second Reaction: Involves H2CO3 (carbonic acid) turning into other products. The rate R2 is k2×[H2CO3]k2×[H2CO3] (assuming C[0] is H2CO3).
//         Third Reaction: Involves HCO3 (bicarbonate) turning into other products. The rate R3 is k3×[HCO3]k3×[HCO3] (assuming C[3] is HCO3).

//     Updating Substrate Rates (subsR):
//         For each substrate, the subsR array is updated to reflect how quickly it is being produced or consumed:
//             subsR[0] = -R2: H2CO3 is consumed in the second reaction.
//             subsR[1] = R3: CO32 (carbonate) is produced in the third reaction.
//             subsR[2] = R1 + R2 + R3: H (hydrogen ion) is produced in all three reactions.
//             subsR[3] = -R3: HCO3 is consumed in the third reaction.
//             subsR[4] = R1: OH (hydroxide ion) is produced in the first reaction.
//             subsR[5] = -R1: H2O is consumed in the first reaction.
